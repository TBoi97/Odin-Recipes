    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This Korean fried chicken recipe is officially my favorite. 
        I've had every style of fried chicken known to man, so I've 
        always considered myself an expert. No other method I've come 
        across has the same combination of tender, juicy, flavorful chicken and 
        plate-scratching crispiness as this recipe does. It's simply a must-try!
